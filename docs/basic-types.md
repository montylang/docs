## Characters & Strings

Unlike Python, Monty distinguishes between characters and strings.

Using single quotes indicates a character:
```python
'h'
```

Using double quotes indicates a string:
```python
"hello"
```

## Numbers

Monty only has double floating point numbers and integers.

Integers are 64 bit signed numbers:
```python
34343
```

Doubles are 64 bit floating points:
```python
3.14
```
